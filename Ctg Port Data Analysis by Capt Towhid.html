                <h2>2. Introduction</h2>
                
                <h3>2.1 Background and Context</h3>
                <p>
                    Chittagong Port, located at the estuary of the Karnaphuli River, stands as the primary maritime hub for Bangladesh. 
                    As the largest seaport in the country, it facilitates over 92% of Bangladesh's total import and export trade. Its role 
                    is critical in supporting industries like garments, agriculture, and manufacturing, which collectively contribute 
                    significantly to the nationâ€™s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Over the past decade, global trade expansion has driven 
                    container traffic growth at the port, amplifying its strategic significance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite its pivotal role in the regional trade network, Chittagong Port faces challenges that hinder operational 
                    efficiency. The growing volume of trade has led to increased vessel congestion, prolonged vessel turnaround times, 
                    and underutilization of port equipment. To mitigate these issues, data-driven decision-making frameworks, particularly 
                    those powered by machine learning and predictive analytics, are being explored. This proposal aims to create a Financial 
                    and Operational Decision Support System (FODSS) that will harness data from port operations to deliver actionable 
                    insights for resource allocation, performance forecasting, and operational optimization.
                </p>
            
                <h3>2.2 Problem Statement</h3>
                <p>
                    The operational performance of Chittagong Port is vital for Bangladeshâ€™s economic growth. However, with increasing 
                    containerized trade volumes, the port faces several operational bottlenecks. Key issues include vessel congestion, 
                    berth occupancy, and delays in cargo handling. The absence of predictive insights limits the port's capacity to optimize 
                    resource utilization and manage operational costs efficiently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The lack of a unified decision support system restricts proactive decision-making. Current resource allocation strategies 
                    are often reactive, relying on historical trends rather than predictive modeling. Additionally, port authorities face 
                    challenges in forecasting future demand for cargo handling, container movement, and revenue generation. Addressing these 
                    issues requires an integrated approach that leverages machine learning models to forecast future trends and support 
                    data-driven decision-making.

                <h2>4. Theoretical Framework</h2>
            
                <h3>4.1 Conceptual Framework of Port Operations</h3>
                <p>
                    The conceptual framework for port operations is designed to provide a structured approach to understanding the flow of goods, 
                    information, and resources within the port. At the heart of port operations are three key components: 
                    <strong>cargo handling</strong>, <strong>vessel management</strong>, and <strong>equipment utilization</strong>. 
                    These components interact dynamically, with vessel arrival and departure schedules dictating the flow of cargo and the deployment 
                    of equipment such as cranes, forklifts, and tugboats. Efficient port operations rely on timely coordination of these activities 
                    to reduce berth occupancy, enhance turnaround times, and minimize operational costs.
                </p>
            
                <h3>4.2 Decision Support Systems (DSS) in Maritime Logistics</h3>
                <p>
                    A <strong>Decision Support System (DSS)</strong> is a computer-based system that supports decision-making by providing data-driven 
                    insights, forecasts, and recommendations. In maritime logistics, DSS integrates operational data, predictive models, and 
                    visualization tools to improve port management. The <strong>Financial and Operational Decision Support System (FODSS)</strong> 
                    proposed in this study will offer real-time insights into port performance, cargo handling, equipment utilization, and financial 
                    outcomes. By incorporating predictive analytics, the DSS will enable port authorities to anticipate changes in cargo volumes, 
                    vessel traffic, and operational costs.
                </p>

                <h3>7.3 Data Integration and Visual Design</h3>
                <p>The integration of data is a crucial part of the dashboard development process. For the Financial Status Dashboard, the primary datasets include "Trend Revenue, Expense, and Asset", "Revenue vs. Expenses Comparison", "Net Profit", and "Total Equity & Liability". Data from these files are merged using "Year" as the primary key. This approach allows for the creation of a complete financial data model with linked KPIs. Revenue, expenditure, and profit figures from each dataset are aggregated and forecasted using linear regression models to predict financial trends up to 2029.</p>
                
                <p>For the Operational Dashboard, data is sourced from "Container TEUS EXPORT and IMPORT", "Trend Import Commodity by Year", "Trend Export Commodity by Year", and "VESSELS Vs Cargo Handled by Year". These files are linked using the "Year" field, creating a comprehensive view of TEU movement, vessel performance, and cargo handling. This data is used to generate operational KPIs, such as total TEU imports/exports, total container movements, and vessel activity.</p>
              
                <p>Once the data is merged, the visual design process begins. The design employs three core visual zones for each dashboard:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li><strong>Top Section:</strong> Displays overall performance metrics such as total revenue, total profit, total TEU imports/exports, and vessel movement.</li>
                  <li><strong>Middle Section:</strong> Includes comparative analysis for TEU movement, container imports/exports, revenue vs expenditure, and vessel movement vs cargo handling.</li>
                  <li><strong>Bottom Section:</strong> Presents forecasts for revenue, expenditure, total assets, and operational performance for the years 2024 to 2029.</li>
                </ol>
              
                <p>Line charts, bar charts, and KPI boxes are used as primary visual elements to ensure clear data interpretation. Forecast data is displayed using dashed-line projections, allowing users to clearly distinguish between historical data and predictions.</p>

                <h2>8. Discussion</h2>
              
                <h3>8.1 Reflection on Research Objectives and Questions</h3>
                <p>The primary objective of this research was to develop a Financial and Operational Decision Support System (DSS) for Chittagong Port to forecast cargo handling volumes, revenue, and operational costs. The research addressed the central question of how machine learning models can be leveraged to improve forecasting accuracy for cargo volumes, revenue, and operational costs. Using advanced analytical tools like ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, and machine learning models such as Random Forest, the research achieved significant success in achieving these objectives. Forecasts showed a 15% increase in cargo handling volume and an 18% rise in revenue over the next three years. These insights provided decision-makers with a data-driven framework for strategic planning, capacity optimization, and financial sustainability.</p>
                
                <p>The research also revealed practical answers to the sub-questions. For example, machine learning models like Random Forest achieved high RÂ² scores of 0.80 for revenue predictions, significantly outperforming linear regression models. The analysis also identified vessel turnaround time and berth occupancy as key drivers of port efficiency. Additionally, interactive dashboards enabled stakeholders to visualize operational trends and identify seasonal patterns, enhancing decision-making and stakeholder engagement.</p>
              
                <h3>8.2 Evaluation of the Machine Learning Models</h3>
                <p>The machine learning models used in this study include Linear Regression, Random Forest, ARIMA, SARIMA, and Prophet. Each model served a specific purpose, with distinct strengths and limitations. Random Forest emerged as the most effective model for forecasting revenue, with an RÂ² score of 0.80 and low Mean Squared Error (MSE) values. These models captured non-linear relationships that were missed by simpler models like Linear Regression.</p>
              
                <p>The time series models ARIMA, SARIMA, and Prophet were pivotal in forecasting cargo handling volumes and revenue. SARIMA identified seasonality, highlighting peaks in Q2, while Prophet projected long-term revenue growth from 2024 to 2035. The ARIMA model captured short-term fluctuations, while SARIMA offered insight into seasonal trends. Together, these models facilitated a comprehensive forecast strategy, with Prophet revealing an anticipated 18% growth in total revenue by 2035.</p>
              
                <h3>8.3 Insights and Implications for Port Management</h3>
                <p>Several key insights emerged from the analysis, each carrying significant implications for port management. The clustering analysis revealed three distinct performance clustersâ€”high, average, and lowâ€”allowing for better scheduling of crane operations, predictive maintenance, and resource allocation. Vessel turnaround time was identified as a critical factor influencing berth occupancy, port congestion, and revenue. The dashboard visualizations demonstrated the necessity for real-time anomaly detection to address port congestion, especially during seasonal peaks. Insights from predictive models showed that optimizing berth occupancy could reduce vessel wait times and enhance customer satisfaction.</p>
              
                <p>The financial analysis revealed that total revenue income is set to grow by 18% from 2024 to 2035. Operational costs are also projected to increase, driven by higher vessel traffic and container handling. This data supports strategic decisions such as allocating capital expenditures, optimizing workforce planning, and scheduling equipment maintenance.</p>
              
                <h3>8.4 Practical Use Cases of the Decision Support System</h3>
                <p>The Financial and Operational Decision Support System (DSS) for Chittagong Port offers several practical use cases for port management and maritime logistics. First, predictive maintenance scheduling can be automated based on clustering results. During "low-performance" cluster periods, maintenance can be scheduled to avoid disruptions during "high-performance" periods. Second, the forecasting capabilities of ARIMA, SARIMA, and Prophet models can be used for long-term planning of cargo volumes, revenue, and resource requirements.</p>
              
                <p>The interactive dashboards developed using Power BI and Tableau offer dynamic insights for port authorities and stakeholders. These dashboards visualize vessel congestion, berth occupancy, and revenue forecasts in real-time. Additionally, anomaly detection from DBSCAN supports incident management and enables the port to preemptively address potential disruptions. This system fosters proactive decision-making, optimizes port efficiency, and improves financial outcomes.</p>
              
                <h3>8.5 Contributions to Theory and Practice</h3>
                <p>This research contributes to both maritime logistics theory and operational practice. The theoretical contribution includes the integration of machine learning, clustering, and time series forecasting models in a single DSS. The practical contribution lies in the creation of dashboards, predictive maintenance strategies, and real-time anomaly detection, which can be implemented at Chittagong Port and other maritime hubs. The use of Random Forest and Prophet models to predict financial indicators demonstrates a novel application of machine learning in maritime logistics.</p>
